# codewars-directions-reduce-where-location-does-not-matter
The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
or
{ "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
or
[North, South, South, East, West, North, West]

You can immediatly see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, 
better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan.
